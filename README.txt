Our application is a simplified version of the Memorial University webpage, made of various unique html pages. The Main page contains a welcome message, events tab, a section displaying the three campuses, and a footer. The Campus page brings you to a course list, here you can add courses to a course catalog and also add courses to a student account. Selecting the Student page brings you to a login page, upon entering a correct username and password, you are able to access a students course enrollment page. The pages for St.John's, Grenfell, and Marine Institute lead you to three different campus pages, each of which can contain student information, a course catalog, and a list of building and location information for the specified campus. Finally, the Directions page you will find a google map application which can lead you from your current location to any of the three previously mentioned campuses, with information for either walking or driving.
